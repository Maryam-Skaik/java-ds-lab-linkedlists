# ✅ Assignment Solutions – Linked Lists Module

This folder contains **model solutions** for the Linked Lists assignments
in the Java Data Structures Lab.

📌 Solutions were published **after semester completion** for learning and revision.

## 📚 Problems Covered

1️⃣ Reverse a Singly Linked List  
2️⃣ Check if a Singly Linked List is a Palindrome  
3️⃣ Reorder a Doubly Linked List (ODD → EVEN values)  
4️⃣ Merge Two Sorted Singly Linked Lists  
5️⃣ Remove Duplicates from an Unsorted SLL  
⭐ Bonus: Rotate a Circular Linked List  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master pointer manipulation
- Understand node ownership and references
- Distinguish between SLL, DLL, and CLL behaviors
- Practice in-place algorithms

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Solutions avoid unnecessary data structures
- Focus is on **algorithmic thinking**, not shortcuts
- Students should try implementing again without reference
